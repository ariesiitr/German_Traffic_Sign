#Traffic Sign Recognition
Open project for 2nd yearites

Have you ever wondered how autonomous vehicles navigate and understand the road environment?
Our project, 'TRAFFIC SIGN RECOGNITION' will help you in understanding this exciting task.

##Team Members:
1.Avnish Yadav
2.Karan Gangwar
3.Komalpreet Kaur
4.Prachi Bahadur Singh

##Mentor:
Somil Dhiman

##Objective:
We aim to develop a robust and efficient traffic sign detection machine learning model that
can accurately recognise traffic signs in real-world driving scenarios, while also accounting for
the variability in appearance and environmental conditions.

##Road Map:

● Research
```
This involved collecting and analyzing a large dataset of traffic sign images, developing and testing multiple 
machine-learning models, and refining our approach based on the results.
We worked over German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset,the link to which has been provided below.

● Model
```
The model has been developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).The code has been written in Anaconda Jupyter notebook.
Further,it has been deployed on website using Flask framework and its deployement code is wriiten in Visual Studio Code IDE.
